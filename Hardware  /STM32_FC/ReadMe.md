## 🔧 Project Overview

This is a hardware-focused flight controller design that includes:

- STM32 microcontroller-based control unit  
- Power supply and buck converter section  
- USB interface for communication  
- UART and I2C connectivity  
- SWD programming/debugging interface  
- Status and power LEDs  
- Compact 4 layer PCB layout    

Designed fully in **KiCad** from schematic → PCB .
