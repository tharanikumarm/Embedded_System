# 🚀 Embedded Systems Learning – Embedded C

Welcome to my embedded systems learning repository!  
This repo serves as my personal learning log, project space, and portfolio for exploring **Embedded C programming**.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository includes:

- ✍️ **Practice programs** in Embedded C      
- 🧠 **Code snippets and notes** from my learning journey  

I am currently learning embedded systems with limited time (about 1 hour daily), so this repository reflects my real-time progress. It will evolve as I grow in knowledge and experience.

Each folder contains:
- Source code
- README or comments describing functionality
