ðŸ”¤ Levels of Programming Languages
In general, there are three levels of programming languages:
Machine Level Language
Assembly Level Language
High-Level Language

ðŸ§  Machine Level Language
This is the only language that a computer can directly understand. It consists of binary values â€” a series of high voltage (1) and low voltage (0) signals â€” also known as machine code. These binary instructions tell the processor exactly what operations to perform. It is extremely fast but very difficult for humans to read or write.

ðŸ”§ Assembly Level Language
Assembly language was introduced to make programming more human-friendly. It uses short English-like mnemonics such as ADD, MOV, and SUB instead of raw binary codes. These mnemonics are then translated into machine code using an assembler. Assembly language provides more control over hardware but is still complex and hardware-specific.

ðŸ’» High-Level Language
High-level languages like C, Python, and Java were created to make programming easier and more abstract. Unlike assembly, you donâ€™t need to manage memory addresses or CPU instructions directly. These languages are closer to human language and can run on multiple hardware platforms using compilers or interpreters. They greatly improve development speed and code readability.
